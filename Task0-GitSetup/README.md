# Task 0 - Git Setup

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This task is part of the HNG Internship and focuses on setting up a GitHub repository and demonstrating the ability to commit and push code.

## âœ… Task Requirements
To complete this task, the following must be done:
1. **Create a GitHub Repository** â€“ A public repository should be created to store internship tasks.
2. **Push a Simple Project** â€“ A small Flutter app should be created and pushed to the repository.
3. **Include Git Usage** â€“ The project should show an understanding of Git, including commits and branches if necessary.
4. **Provide Links to GitHub and HNG Developer Page** â€“ The app should have buttons that link to these pages.

## ðŸ“‚ Subdirectory: Tap2Git App
The `Tap2Git` app was created to satisfy Task 0 requirements. This app contains buttons that open:
- The GitHub repository where the code is hosted.
- The HNG developer hiring page for Flutter developers.
