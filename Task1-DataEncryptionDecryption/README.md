# Task 1 - Data Encryption & Decryption Program Using GitHub Gist

## üìå Overview

This task is part of the Mobile-Desktop Track for Stage 1. Your objective is to develop a program that securely encrypts and decrypts data. The solution must be implemented in one of the following languages: Dart, JavaScript/TypeScript (React), Swift, or Kotlin/Java (Android). The code should be case sensitive and modular, demonstrating a clear understanding of encryption concepts and secure data handling.

## ‚ú® Requirements

### **Programming Language Options:**
- **Dart:** (Flutter support is optional)
- **React:** (Using JavaScript or TypeScript)
- **Swift:** (For an iOS application or command-line interface)
- **Kotlin/Java:** (For Android applications or CLI)

### **Functionality:**
- **Encryption:**  
  - Create a method/function to encrypt a given plaintext string.
  - Use a secret key (a string) to perform encryption.
  - Implement a custom encryption algorithm.
- **Decryption:**  
  - Create a method/function to decrypt the encrypted string back to its original plaintext form using the same secret key.
- **Case Sensitivity:**  
  - The program must handle input in a case-sensitive manner.

### **Input/Output:**
- **Encryption:**
  - **Input:** Plaintext string and a secret key.
  - **Output:** Encrypted string.
- **Decryption:**
  - **Input:** Encrypted string and a secret key.
  - **Output:** Original plaintext string.

### **Code Structure:**
- Ensure the code is modular with clear, reusable functions or methods.
- Include inline comments and documentation to explain the logic behind the encryption and decryption processes.

## üöÄ Deliverables

1. **GitHub Gist:**
   - Create a public GitHub Gist containing your source code file(s).
   - Include detailed instructions for how to use your encryption/decryption program.
   - Provide example inputs and outputs.

2. **Bonus (Optional):**
   - Develop an interactive user interface (e.g., a Flutter UI, a React web form, or an Android app UI) to demonstrate the functionality.
   - If you create an interactive interface, deploy the app (for instance, using Appetize.io) and include the demo link in your documentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Testing

1. **Implement the Program:**
   - Write your encryption and decryption functions.
   - Test your custom algorithm with various inputs to ensure correctness and robustness.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Comment your code thoroughly.
   - Prepare a usage guide within the Gist that includes sample commands or UI instructions, expected inputs, and outputs.

3. **GitHub Gist:**
   - Publish your source code and documentation on GitHub Gist for public collaboration and code reuse.

## üìú Dependencies

- **Chosen Programming Language** (as per your selection above)
- Any additional libraries or frameworks required by your implementation
