XORIFY – A Simple XOR-based Encryption & Decryption App 🔐✨

Overview:
------------
Xorify is a Flutter-powered application that demonstrates custom encryption and decryption using a simple XOR algorithm. It’s designed to be both beginner-friendly and useful for professionals who want to learn about basic encryption techniques. The app is case sensitive—meaning uppercase and lowercase characters are treated as distinct—making it an ideal tool for understanding encryption fundamentals. 

Features:
------------
• Custom XOR Algorithm: Encrypts and decrypts text using the XOR operation on UTF‑16 code units.  
• Case Sensitive: Treats characters like “A” and “a” differently, preserving the original case.  
• Intuitive User Interface:  
   - Two text fields: one for entering the message (plaintext or hexadecimal ciphertext) and one for the secret key.  
   - Helpful tooltips and helper text guide you on what to input.  
   - Buttons for “Encrypt,” “Decrypt,” “Copy,” and “Clear” make operations simple.  
• Clean & Centered Layout: All elements are centered for an optimal viewing experience on any device.  
• Organized Codebase: Separation of encryption logic, UI components, themes, and testing ensures maintainability and clarity.  
• Tested & Verified: Unit tests confirm that the core encryption and decryption functions work as expected.  
  
How It Works:
----------------
Xorify uses a straightforward XOR operation to encrypt text:
1. For each character in your input message, its UTF‑16 code is retrieved.  
2. The code is XOR’ed with the corresponding code from your secret key (cycling the key if necessary).  
3. The result is converted to a hexadecimal string that represents your encrypted message.  
4. Decryption follows the reverse process: the hexadecimal string is converted back to bytes, and XOR is applied again using the same key to retrieve the original text.  

Getting Started:
---------------------
Prerequisites:
– Flutter must be installed on your machine 🚀  
– A basic understanding of Flutter development is helpful, but not required.

Installation & Running:
1. Clone or download the Xorify project.  
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.  
3. Run the following command to get dependencies:
      flutter pub get  
4. To run the app on your connected device or emulator, execute:
      flutter run

Using Xorify:
-----------------
• Launch the app.  
• In the “Enter text” field, input the message you want to encrypt (or paste the hexadecimal ciphertext to decrypt).  
• In the “Enter key” field, type your secret key (e.g., hello123).  
• Tap “Encrypt” to convert your message into a hexadecimal string or “Decrypt” to recover the original text.  
• The result will be displayed below, and you can tap the “Copy” button to copy the result to your clipboard or “Clear” to reset the fields.  

Example:
-----------
Input Message: HelloXorify  
Key: SecretKey  
Encrypted Output: (A sample hexadecimal string based on your input)  
Decrypted Output: Should match the original message “HelloXorify” 😊

Future Enhancements:
---------------------------
• Add animations or transitions for a more engaging user experience.  
• Offer a toggle switch for seamless switching between encryption and decryption modes.  
• Expand the app to include additional encryption methods for comparison.  
• Enhance error handling and provide more detailed user feedback.
